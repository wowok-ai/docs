## Implementation Case Study

### Flower Delivery: A Complete Business Scenario

The flower delivery case demonstrates how to build a complete business on Wowok, from simple customer requests to programmable execution.

**Business Scenario:**
Sarah needs white roses delivered to Emma by 3 PM for a birthday surprise. She describes her need once: "White roses for Emma's birthday, delivered with something personal – she loves watercolor art." The system matches her with Jake, whose artistic skills and $3 watercolor premium create exactly the personalized touch Emma would love.

**Technical Value:**
This case provides a complete technical blueprint using Wowok's object system - Permission management, Repository communication, Guard verification, Machine workflow, and Service integration. Each component becomes reusable infrastructure that other providers can reference and build upon.
