## Implementation Case Study

The flower delivery case demonstrates how to build a complete business on Wowok, from simple customer requests to programmable execution.

- **Business Scenario:**


    Sarah needs white roses delivered to Emma by 3 PM for a birthday surprise. She describes her need once: "White roses for Emma's birthday, delivered with something personal – she loves watercolor art." The system matches her with Jake, whose artistic skills and $3 watercolor premium create exactly the personalized touch Emma would love.
