# Arbitration Object: Your Fair Dispute Resolver

> "When things go wrong, fairness matters. Create transparent, automated dispute resolution that everyone can trust."

## What You'll Build (30 seconds)

By the end, you will have three working arbitration systems and understand dispute resolution:

- **Basic Arbitration** ‚Äî simple voting-based dispute resolution
- **Expert Arbitration** ‚Äî weighted expert panels with qualification requirements
- **Automated Arbitration** ‚Äî evidence-based resolution with smart evaluation

**Prereqs**: You already created Service and Order objects with potential disputes. Network is `sui testnet`. Token type is `0x2::sui::SUI`.

**Pre-flight** (copy one line):

```
"On sui testnet, show my default account and SUI balance; if low, guide me to the faucet and wait for funds."
```

## üéØ Level 1 ‚Äî Foundation (fair voting works)

**Scenario**: You need a way to resolve disputes fairly when customers and service providers disagree.

**Your Mission**: Create your first Arbitration system with community-based voting.

**Try This**:

```
"Create an Arbitration object for service disputes on sui testnet. Set up a voting system where community members can vote on disputes. Create a test dispute case for a consulting service disagreement and show how voters can cast votes and reach decisions."
```

**üí° If you get stuck**: Ask your AI "Help me create an Arbitration object with voting system" or "How do I create and vote on dispute cases?"

**Success Looks Like**:

## üéØ Level 2 ‚Äî Application (expert panels decide better)

**Scenario**: Complex disputes need qualified experts, not just popular opinion.

**Your Mission**: Create an expert-based Arbitration system with weighted voting and qualification requirements.

**Try This**:

```
"Create an expert Arbitration system on sui testnet where only qualified arbitrators can vote. Set up voting guards that verify professional certification and expertise levels. Give different voting weights based on arbitrator qualifications and show how expert panels make decisions."
```

**üí° If you get stuck**: Ask your AI "Help me create Arbitration with qualified expert voting" or "How do I set up voting guards for arbitrator qualification?"

**Success Looks Like**:

- ‚úÖ Only qualified experts can participate in arbitration
- ‚úÖ Voting weights reflect expertise and experience levels
- ‚úÖ Guard objects verify arbitrator qualifications automatically
- ‚úÖ Expert decisions carry more authority and accuracy

**Why This Matters**: Expert Arbitration enables:

- **Quality decisions**: Qualified experts make better judgments
- **Specialized knowledge**: Industry-specific expertise applied to disputes
- **Weighted influence**: More experienced arbitrators have greater impact
- **Professional standards**: Maintains high quality in dispute resolution

**Pro Tip**: Well-designed expert panels can resolve 90% of disputes fairly while maintaining community trust.

## üéØ Level 3 ‚Äî Integration (smart evidence evaluation)

**Scenario**: You want arbitration that can automatically evaluate evidence and make data-driven decisions.

**Your Mission**: Create an intelligent Arbitration system that uses on-chain evidence for automated resolution.

**Try This**:

```
"Create Automated Arbitration for evidence-based dispute resolution on sui testnet. Design a system that automatically evaluates: Order completion status, Machine workflow progress, Treasury payment records, and Repository credential data. Show how the Arbitration can make decisions based on objective evidence rather than subjective opinions, with human arbitrators only needed for edge cases."
```

**Success Looks Like**:

- ‚úÖ Arbitration automatically evaluates objective evidence
- ‚úÖ On-chain data (Orders, Progress, Treasury records) informs decisions
- ‚úÖ Most disputes are resolved without human intervention
- ‚úÖ Complex cases escalate to human arbitrators when needed

**Why This Matters**: Automated Arbitration enables:

- **Objective decisions**: Based on verifiable on-chain evidence
- **Instant resolution**: No waiting for human arbitrators
- **Cost efficiency**: Automated resolution reduces arbitration fees
- **Scalable justice**: Handle thousands of disputes automatically

**Level Up**: These automated systems can power large-scale marketplaces with minimal human oversight.

## üí° Mini Challenge ‚Äî Community Arbitration System

**Goal**: Create a comprehensive arbitration system for a community marketplace with multiple dispute types.

**Try This**:

```
"Create Community Arbitration for a local services marketplace on sui testnet. Handle different dispute types: service quality issues, payment disputes, delivery problems, and contract violations. Set up tiered arbitration: automated resolution for simple cases, community voting for moderate disputes, and expert panels for complex issues. Include reputation tracking for both service providers and arbitrators."
```

**Creative Ideas**:

- **Freelance platform**: Handle project disputes with portfolio-based evidence
